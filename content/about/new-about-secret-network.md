###### Paying Fees

To use applications on Secret, you need to hold and spend SCRT. Just like how ETH works on Ethereum, SCRT is used to pay all computational and transactional fees associated with applicaitons on the network.

###### STAKE SCRT

### Help Secure the Network & Receive Rewards

Secret Network uses Delegated Proof of Stake as a consensus algorithm, meaning secret nodes around the world must stake SCRT in order to process transactions and computations. In return, they earn a share of all new SCRT created over time.

If you want to help secure Secret Network while receiving a share of these rewards, you can either run your own secret node or stake your SCRT with someone who does. It’s a great opportunity to support the network. Stakers currently earn between 25 and 30% ROI on their SCRT! All you’ll need to get started is some SCRT and a wallet.

###### SCRT GOVERNANCE

### Submit & Vote on Proposals to Improve the Network

By staking, you can also participate in network governance. That means you can submit and vote on proposals to improve and secure Secret Network. With over 50 proposals having already been submitted on-chain, community governance is critical to the growth of our network and ecosystem.

###### USE SCRT

### Secret Applications

If you’ve got your SCRT secured and you’re storing it in Keplr Wallet, you’re ready to start using applications on the network! SCRT is used to pay for transactional and computational fees, so when you interact with any Secret App, you’ll spend a bit of SCRT to be able to use them.
