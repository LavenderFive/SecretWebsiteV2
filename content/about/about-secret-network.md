##### WHAT IS SECRET NETWORK?

### A blockchain-based, open-source protocol that lets anyone perform computations on encrypted data, bringing privacy to smart contracts and public blockchains.

Secret Network combines the best features of decentralized, open-source networks and blockchains with the benefits of data privacy and improved usability. These improvements are critical for achieving mass adoption. By supporting encrypted inputs, encrypted outputs, and encrypted state for smart contracts, Secret Network allows for new kinds of powerful decentralized applications to be built. 

The Secret Network blockchain is based on Cosmos SDK / Tendermint, meaning the network has its own independent consensus, on-chain governance, and features like slashing and delegation.

##### WHY IS PRIVACY IMPORTANT?


#### Protect your data with viewing keys. Choose what is revealed to the public and what stays private by default. 

SCRT is the native coin of the Secret Network blockchain. It is used to for staking and governance on the Secret Network. SCRT can be purchased on exchanges and stored on wallets that support Secret Tokens. Wallets are required to interact with the Secret ecosystem.

##### WHAT IS SECRET (SCRT)?

### SCRT is digital, global money.<br>It's the currency of Secret Network apps.

Privacy needs to be protected and supported by the technologies we use in daily life. However, an overly centralized internet and large data monopolies have put our privacy, our security, and our society at risk. That’s why we are dedicated to building solutions with privacy at their core, empowering users to take and keep control of their valuable information. Privacy makes the applications we rely on more usable and more secure - and when privacy is not protected, neither are we.

The Secret Network is a decentralized network of computers (secret nodes) that utilize trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enable secure, private computation over encrypted data. TEEs function like a “black box” for data processing, and they are utilized in all types of everyday platforms such as smartphones and video game consoles.

<!-- WHAT CAN SECRET CONTRACTS DO? -->

##### WHAT CAN SECRET CONTRACTS DO?

### Programmable privacy for blockchains allow decentralized applications to be built with privacy by design.

"Secret contracts" are privacy-preserving smart contracts built on Secret Network. Smart contracts are essentially self-executing pieces of code that are managed on a blockchain. Secret contracts improve on regular smart contracts in that they not only solve for correctness, but also for data privacy. Secret contracts are written in the Rust programming language. Secret Apps utilize the capabilities of secret contracts to enable unique use cases that empower users and increase opportunities for growth and impact.

##### SECRET TOKENS?

#### Convert existing public assets into privacy Secret Tokens.

Secret Tokens (SNIP-20) are smart contract interactions on Secret Network that mint tokens that are private by default, encrypted to ensure both anonymity and confidentiality. Viewing keys are required to view token balances, transaction details, and token metadata. Secret Tokens can be used in various use cases, most notably in "Secret Defi" and in a new NFT standard for "SecretNFTs".

##### SECRET BRIDGES

#### Secret Network brings programmable privacy to all major blockchains.

Secret Bridges transfers assets on other blockchain networks (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc) to Secret Network. Once assets are transferred across a Secret Bridge, a Secret Token contract is executed and the asset is encrypted to be only viewable to address owners or holders of their viewing key. These Secret Tokens can then be used across the Secret Network ecosystem. Secret Bridges enable Secret Network to become the cross-chain privacy hub for all major blockchains.

##### SECRET DECENTRALIZED FINANCE

#### Privacy for sensitive financial data.

Secret Finance encompasses all privacy-preserving decentralized financial applications enabled by smart contracts built on Secret Network. Secret DeFi applications are cross-chain interoperable, front-running and MEV resistant, private by default, and utilize low fees.  Secret Finance also offers high-yield opportunities for incentivizing growth.

##### SECRET NFTs

#### Non-Fungible tokens with private metadata.

SecretNFTs are non-fungible Secret Tokens, which enable verifiable representation of unique items and events, such that ownership and transactions are private by default. These unique items can be used for a variety of purposes, but generally, we believe tokens ought to be private if they represent our personal goods and experiences. Secret NFTs are perfect for these types of use cases.
