### DApps

Secret Apps are made from powerful, privacy-preserving smart contracts (i.e. secret contracts). Leveraging the
computational privacy of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and secret contracts, users have privacy by default
when interacting with Secret Apps - unlocking the full value of decentralized applications.
